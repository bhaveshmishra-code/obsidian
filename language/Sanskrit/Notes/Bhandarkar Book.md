Accusative Case

Nounds ending in a

|           | Singular | Dual | Plural |

| Masculine | म्       | औ    | आन्    |

Nouns ending in इ


|     | Singular | Dual | Plural |
| --- | -------- | ---- | ------ |
|     | म्      |      | न्    |
The ending इ is lengthened in the dual and before the न् of the plural.


The accusative forms of neuter nouns are always the same as those of the nominative.

| अगद      | medicine    |

Grammar Rules
When ए or ओ at the end of a word or grammatical form is followed by अ the latter merges into the former i.e. it is neither pronounced nor written. In its place the mark ऽ is generally put.

Verbs implying the motion govern the accusative, and sometimes the dative, of the place to which the motion is directed.

When इ, उ, ऋ short or long are followed by a dissimilar vowel, य्, व्, र्, ल् are respectively substituted for them.

A final न् when followed by च्, छ्, त्, थ् and ट्, ठ् is changed to an `anusvara` and `visarga`

## Lesson 19
Masculine and neuter nouns ending in उ & ऋ

Nouns of masculine gender ending in उ are declined like those ending in इ with this difference that where इ, ई, ए, य् occurs in the latter, उ, ऊ, ओ, व् should be substituted in the former.

Nouns of neuter gender ending in उ, ऋ are declined like वारि. ऊ, ऋ being substituted for इ, ऊ or ऋ for ई and O, अर् for ए

Masculine nouns ending in ऋ change it to आर् before the terminations of the nominative and of the singular and dual of the accusative. A few nouns, such as पितृ, भ्रात्र्, जामातृ, नृ, देवृ, सव्येष्टृ change the final ऋ to अर्.

The nominative singular of all ends in आ, र् and the termination स् being dropped.

How to negate a word
- अ prefixed to words beginning with a consonant.
- अन् to those beginning with a vowel

- छ् following a vowel is changed to च्छ्. This change takes place optionally when the vowel is long and at the end of a word or grammatical form; but after मा and आ it is necessary

## Lesson 24
Some more important verbal derivatives
The past passive participle is formed by adding त to the root e.g. श्रुत

The infinitive of purpose is formed by adding तुम् to the root. The final vowel or the penultimate short takes its `guna` substitute before this termination.

The indeclinable past participle or absolutive is formed by adding त्वा to the root. 
य takes the place of त्वा when a preposition is prefixed to the root. 
त् is prefixed to this य when the roots ends in a short vowel

Before all these terminations except य some roots take the augment इ. As a general rule however roots ending in short vowels don't take it.

Present Participle
To form the present participle, the conjugational sign is first affixed to the root and then the termination अत् is added onto it when the root takes `P` terminations and मान् when it takes `A` terminations.

आन however, takes the place of मान when the base does not end in अ

Passive present participles are formed by adding मान to the passive base.

- When there are more than one consonants at the end of a word, the first is retained and the others dropped
- Nouns ending in मत् and वत् when masculine prefix a न् to the final त् in the first 5 inflections.

- Present participles differ from this only in the nominative singular, the अ of the last syllable being short, as गच्छत् (present participle) गच्छन् (nominative singular)
